Usage
=====
There are two methods by which to use the namelist tool. They are described in detail below. 

command line
------------

This command line tool reads a BDY file, extracts boundary data and prepares
the data for a NEMO simulation. The bdy file is a plain text file containing 
key value pairs. Please look at the sample `namelist.bdy 
<http://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/gf/project/pynemo/scmsvn/?action=browse&path=%2Ftrunk%2FPython%2Fdata%2Fnamelist.bdy&view=markup>`_ 
file, which shares common syntax with the NEMO simulation namelist input file. 

.. note:: Directory paths in bdy file can be relative or absolute. 
          The application picks the relative path from the current working 
          directory.

Syntax for pynemo command is

::

   > pynemo [-g] -s <bdy file>

For help

::

   > pynemo -h 
   > usage: pynemo [-g] -s <namelist.bdy>
   >        -g (optional) will open settings editor before extracting the data
   >        -s <bdy filename> file to use

Example comamnd

::

   > pynemo -g -s namelist.bdy


gui
---

This tool will open a window where you can edit the mask and change the values of bdy parameters.

Syntax for pynemo_settings_editor command is

::

   > pnl  <namelist1> <namelist2>
   
.. note:: If no file name is specified then a file dialog box will open to select a file.

For help

::

   > pynemo_settings_editor -h
   > usage: pynemo_settings_editor -s <namelist.bdy>
   
Example:

::
   
   pynemo_settings_editor -s namelist.bdy
